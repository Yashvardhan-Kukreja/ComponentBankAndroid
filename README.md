# Component Bank Android
Android code for Component Bank App
# Description
Presently, This app is bound to work for IEEE VIT Students Chapter. In this app, the user creates an account and he gets a list of all the components owned by a central organisation (IEEE). If he wants a component, he can request the component from the central organisation and later on, the organisation can approve his request and lend him the component. Just in case, the components are not available and the user needs a component urgently, then, he can get a list of all the other users who issued that component before, and then he can call one of the issuers through the app and borrow the component directly from them.
